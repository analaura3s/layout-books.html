                        This book was initially a Google Spreadsheet we (Gijs and Danny) created for <br> our own projects. We were sick and tired of those days we kept looking at a<br> blank screen, unable to come up with any headlines, titles or subject lines.

                            We a/b tested the new headlines on the websites of our clients and got <br> amazing results. Some headlines even doubled the initial conversion rates!

                Quickly, word spread around town, and a few co-workers asked us if we <br>   could share this “secret” collection of converting headlines with them.<br>  We did. They tested some of our headlines and saw some very positive <br>  results with these headlines as well. 
            </p>
            <p>
                They were blown away by the massive impact a headline could make.<br>  This success inspired us to share our collection of 200 headlines with <br>  everyone.
